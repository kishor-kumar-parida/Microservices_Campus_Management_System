# 📚 Smart Campus Management System – Sprint 1

## 🚀 Sprint 1 : Foundational Development
This is the foundational sprint for a **Smart Campus Management System (SCMS)** built using **Core Java**, **JDBC**, and **SQL**. The system supports basic operations like student registration, course management, timetable structuring, faculty assignment, and input/output handling.

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goal
To create the **core data model** and **backend logic** using:
- Normalized SQL schema
- Core Java POJOs (with inheritance and collections)
- JDBC CRUD operations
- Thread simulation for concurrency
- Input handling and basic logging

## 🧱 Core Components

### ✅ SQL Schema
- Normalized tables for `Students`, `Courses`, `Faculty`, `Timetable` and `Enrollments`
- Keys, constraints, indexing, and views implemented
- Sample data inserted for testing

### ✅ Java POJOs
- Implemented `Person`, `Student`, `Faculty` classes
- Used **inheritance**, **access modifiers**, **constructors**, and **collections**

### ✅ JDBC Integration
- CRUD operations using JDBC
- Proper connection handling
- Prepared statements and exception handling

### ✅ Concurrency Simulation
- Threaded student enrollments
- `synchronized` blocks for consistency

### ✅ Input and Logging
- Used `Scanner` for user input
- Formatted responses
